Scrape a Wikipedia page and record which passages need citations.
E.g. History of Mexico has 7 “citation needed” cases, as of this writing.
Your web scraper should report the number of citations needed.
Your web scraper should identify those cases AND include the relevant passage.
E.g. Citation needed for “lorem spam and impsum eggs”
Consider the “relevant passage” to be the parent element that contains the passage, often a paragraph element.
